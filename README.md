  #### Wait, what happens when I click that button?

  Good question. Here's what it will do...

  1. Netlify will clone the git repository of this project into your Github account. This action will require your permission from Github, and of course a Netlify account. 
  2. Netlify will then create a new site for you, and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing changes to your repo.
  3. Enjoy your new website ðŸŽ‰
