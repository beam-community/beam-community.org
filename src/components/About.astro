          <strong class="text-slate-900">BEAM Community</strong> is a collection of open source
          projects maintained by a dedicated group of volunteers. We serve as stewards for libraries
          that the Elixir and Erlang ecosystem depends on every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the Apache Software Foundation does for the Java ecosystem, we provide a home for
          community-critical packages — ensuring they receive ongoing maintenance, security updates,
          and thoughtful evolution even as original authors move on.
        </p>
        <p>
          BEAM is part of the Erlang Run-Time System (ERTS), the virtual machine that powers both
          Elixir and Erlang. It's known for building fault-tolerant, concurrent, and distributed
          systems — and our projects help developers make the most of it.
