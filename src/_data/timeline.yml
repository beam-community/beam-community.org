      - caption: Research begins to determine an appropriate language for new telecom systems
        details: "This was the beginning research phase trying to determine what might be a great building block for new types of telecom software. They wanted something that had high level abstractions to allow for large productivity gains, trying to break out of constraints introduced from their current systems. Leading contenders included Prolog and Lisp, among others."
